Guide to Cybersecurity Controls for Critical Systems (CSCC) Implementation
Introduction
The National Cybersecurity Authority (referred to in this document as "NCA") has developed a guide for applying the cybersecurity controls stipulated in the Cybersecurity Controls for Critical Systems (CSCC - 1: 2019) (referred to in this document as the "Controls"), in order to contribute in enabling national organizations to implement the requirements of compliance with Cybersecurity Controls for Critical Systems. Where this guide was built based on the information and experiences that NCA has collected and analyzed since the publication of the controls and the alignment of this guide with the leading best practices in cybersecurity to facilitate the application of the controls in the national authorities.

Objectives
The main objective of this guide is to contribute to enabling national entities to achieve the requirements of compliance with the application of cybersecurity controls for critical systems in the entity, with the aim of raising and enhancing their level of cybersecurity, and reducing cybersecurity risks that arise from internal and external cyber threats.

Scope of work and applicability
The scope of work for this guide as mentioned in Cybersecurity Controls for Critical Systems
(CSCC-1:2019) is:
• Public entities that own or operate critical systems, whether they are governmental entities inside or outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (e.g. ministries, agencies, institutions, embassies, etc.), entities and their subsidiaries, and private sector entities (all referred to in this document as the "Entity").
• NCA strongly encourages other entities within the kingdom to utilize these controls to implement best practices for enhancing and developing cybersecurity within their respective organizations.
