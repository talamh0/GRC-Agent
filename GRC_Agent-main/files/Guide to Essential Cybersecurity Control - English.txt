5-1-4
The cybersecurity requirements related to Industrial Controls Systems and Operational Technology (ICS/OT) must be reviewed periodically.

Control implementation guidelines:
â€¢ Review and update the cybersecurity policy and requirements for ICS/OT in the organization periodically according to a documented and approved plan for review and based on a planned interval (e.g., review must be conducted annually) or in the event of changes in relevant laws and regulations. Document the review and changes to the cybersecurity requirements for ICS/OT protection in the organization and approve them by the head of the organization or his/her deputy.

Expected deliverables:
â€¢ An approved document that sets the policy's review schedule
â€¢ Policy indicating that it is up to date and the changes to the cybersecurity requirements for ICS/OT protection have been documented and approved by the head of the organization or his/her deputy.
â€¢ Formal approval by the head of the organization or his/her deputy on the updated policy (e.g., via the organization's official e-mail, paper or electronic signature).
